Rules: has to support basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /)
as well as parenthesis.
Option 1: use a tree, all integer values are leaf nodes and
operators are intermediate nodes. Doesn"t really make sense for
this because unlike traditional math, evaluations are done
strictly left to right and multiplication/division doesn"t have
higher priority than addition, which leads to...

Option 2: just use a stack, evaluate as we go. when we encounter
a left paren, push the current state onto the stack, evaluate the contents
of the parens, then when we encounter left paren, reduce, then evaluate what
we put on the stack.
